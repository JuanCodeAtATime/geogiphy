# Geogiphy by Juan Rivera

The Geogiphy app, powered by Giphy (API), allows users to search for gifs by country.  

Featured country buttons allow Users to search for gifs at the click of a button.

The app also allows Users to search for other countries, and it adds those countries to the buttons array.

But wait, there's more!  The gifs that are generated by the User come in groups of ten, and rendered in a still state.  On click, the User can change the state of the gifs from 'still' to 'animate'.

The search field has no limitations and allows Users to search any term.  Although this may be a convenient feature for the User, this function could probably be enhanced by restricitng User input to countries only via an auto-complete feature.  

Although there are pros and cons to both of these search parameter options, an array of all countries is saved in the JS file just incase we decide to modify this feature in the future.  

This app was developed (and maintained) by Juan Rivera.  It is his Week 6 homework project at the Harvard Extension School's Coding Bootcamp (Full Stack Developer Program).
